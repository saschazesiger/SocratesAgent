/**
 * Overlays (D18): the dialog, the side sheet, the modal drawer and the
 * popups (.ds-menu, .ds-combo__popup) open and close through one pair of
 * calls, so focus, inertness, Escape and the scroll lock behave the same
 * everywhere.
 *
 *   DS.overlay.open(dialog, { opener: button });   // a Promise: the entrance settled
 *   DS.overlay.close(dialog);                      // a Promise: hidden again
 *   DS.overlay.close(dialog, { reason: 'confirm' }); // why: the ds-close event says it
 *   DS.overlay.topmost();                          // the top open layer, or null
 *   await DS.overlay.confirm({ title, text });     // a built dialog: true or false
 *
 * Kinds, recognised by class: a native <dialog class="ds-dialog | ds-sheet">
 * (showModal() is the focus trap and makes the page inert), the div
 * markup .ds-dialog / .ds-sheet (the siblings of the overlay and of each
 * of its ancestors up to <body> turn inert, .ds-scrim excepted), the modal
 * drawer .ds-drawer (only while (max-width: 900px) matches; wider, open()
 * resolves at once) and the popups .ds-menu and .ds-combo__popup (no
 * trap, no lock). Any other element is opened like a popup.
 *
 * Motion is state-driven: open() sets data-state="closed", flushes style,
 * writes the origin (originFrom(opener, box) for dialogs and popups) and
 * sets data-state="open"; close() sets data-state="closed". The CSS
 * transitions keyed on data-state therefore reverse from the current value
 * when a close is taken back (D21). The drawer keeps its own attribute,
 * data-drawer-open on .ds-app.
 *
 * Every element has one state with a generation: a later open() or
 * close() supersedes an earlier call, whose promise then resolves without
 * acting. A second close() during an exit returns the same promise; open()
 * on an open overlay does nothing.
 *
 * Close order (the same for dialog, sheet and modal drawer): release the
 * trap (native: dialog.close() at once plus .ds-dialog--closing /
 * .ds-sheet--closing, which keeps it displayed and stacked outside the top
 * layer; div: restore the inert it set), focus the opener at once (gone:
 * returnTo(), the opener's id twin, the nearest tabindex="-1" ancestor or
 * landmark, never <body>), make only the box or panel inert (the backdrop
 * keeps swallowing clicks, and a mousedown on it or the drawer's scrim is
 * prevented, so focus stays on the opener), set data-state="closed", send
 * ds-close ({ detail: { reason } }, bubbling, once), wait for settled(),
 * then hide (div: hidden; native: drop --closing), clear the box's inert
 * and .ds-dialog--nested, unlock the scroll and leave the Escape stack, in
 * one task. Popups return focus to their opener only when it was inside
 * them and the close was not a click outside.
 *
 * Busy: while the page sets data-ds-busy on a dialog, sheet or drawer, the
 * user's close attempts do nothing (Escape, the native cancel, a
 * [data-close] click, the backdrop and the drawer's scrim): one guard at
 * the top of closeFrom(), before the popups inside close, so a refused
 * attempt changes nothing and sends no ds-close. close(el) and the forced
 * closes (removed, breakpoint) still close; menus and lists ignore it.
 *
 * Dismiss guard: a backdrop or scrim click from a pointer closes only when
 * the press began on it, it is the first click (event.detail 1) and
 * --ds-delay-dismiss has passed since the open; a [data-close] click with
 * detail > 1 never closes. click(), Enter and Space (detail 0) close at
 * once.
 *
 * Container transform (opt-in): open(el, { opener, container: true }) on
 * a dialog or side sheet runs the open inside DS.motion.transition() with
 * type 'container', so the opener (a card, a row) grows into the box or
 * panel on the spring over --ds-dur-long while the scrim fades with the
 * root's crossfade; the overlay skips its own entrance for that open (the
 * live image would grow twice), and the page frame and the sheet's body
 * keep no view-transition-name meanwhile (named, they would paint above
 * the scrim or apart from the panel). The page is frozen while it runs, so
 * it is never the default. close() keeps its own exit. Without View
 * Transitions, or without .ds-theme on <html>, it is the usual entrance
 * from the opener; an opener that its scroller clips (a group would paint
 * its hidden part over the top bar) gets that entrance inside a short
 * fade-through.
 *
 * Escape stack: one keydown listener on the document (bubble phase, so a
 * widget inside the overlay that handles Escape itself and calls
 * preventDefault() keeps it open) closes the topmost overlay that is not
 * already closing, unless a tooltip took the key or the key came from a
 * filled input[type="search"] inside that overlay (it clears the search
 * and fires input; the next Escape closes); the stack is shared by
 * every copy of ds.js on the page (sharedOf), so the topmost layer closes
 * whichever copy opened it. A native dialog's cancel
 * event is turned into close(), so its exit plays. Closing a dialog, sheet
 * or the drawer first closes the menus and lists open inside it and hides
 * the tooltip. [data-close] inside an overlay closes it (ignored while
 * closing); the scrim closes the modal drawer; a menu also closes on Tab
 * (focus goes back to its trigger and Tab moves on from there) and on a
 * pointerdown outside the menu and its trigger.
 *
 * Popups (D17): a menu or a combobox list is placed before it enters, at
 * rest size, then grows from its trigger (originFrom(): the origin and the
 * clip edge). Where popover and CSS anchor positioning exist it opens as
 * popover="manual" in the top layer, anchored to its trigger (a combobox
 * list to its field, as wide as the field), so no scrolling box clips it;
 * elsewhere a menu is placed by --ds-menu-x/-y (below the trigger from its
 * start edge, towards the start edge without room, following scroll and
 * resize) and a combobox list stays absolute under its field. A popup
 * opens below when it fits, else on the side with more room
 * (data-placement="top" above; for the list, the viewport narrowed by
 * clipping boxes), never taller than that room (anchored: the CSS cap of
 * its position-area; else an inline max-height), so it never covers its
 * trigger. While it is open, DS.dom.scrollEdges() watches the block axis
 * of what scrolls (the menu, the combobox's list), so a cut edge fades
 * where scroll timelines are missing too. Over an open native dialog or
 * sheet (showModal() makes the rest inert, top-layer popovers too) a
 * menu, popup, dialog or sheet (div
 * or native) moves inside it while it shows and back once closed; a native
 * one so that its exit, outside the top layer at once, stays above the
 * sheet's panel and its scrim keeps catching clicks. A menu focuses
 * its first enabled item (the last one when an ArrowUp keydown opened it),
 * moves focus with ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Home and End (wrapping), to the next
 * item whose label starts with the typed letters (type-ahead; the letters
 * reset after --ds-delay-tooltip) and closes a task after an item's click,
 * once the item's handlers ran. The items of a dialog's .ds-dialog__list
 * (an action sheet) take the same arrow keys.
 *
 * Scroll lock: reference-counted per document (lockScroll(doc) /
 * unlockScroll(doc), default the global one; modal kinds lock their own
 * document, a contained dialog none). body.ds-no-scroll (needs .ds-base)
 * toggles only on 0 <-> 1.
 * When the lock really removes a classic scrollbar of the page, its room
 * is kept: scrollbar-gutter: stable on <html>, else a padding-right on
 * <body>; in the app frame, where .ds-view scrolls, nothing is reserved.
 *
 * Inert follows the stack: each div trap (and the drawer) records what
 * it took, and an element is inert while a trap holds it and no overlay
 * above that trap sits inside it. So overlays opened over each other (a
 * dialog from a div sheet or from the modal drawer) take input, and
 * closing in any order restores exactly what was taken. A contained dialog
 * (.ds-dialog--contained) traps only inside its positioned container: the
 * page around it (a host page around an embedded widget) stays usable.
 *
 * An overlay that the page removes from the document while it is open or
 * closing (a route change, a re-render) is closed at once, without motion:
 * a MutationObserver, connected while the stack holds anything, notices
 * the removal, and its lock, inert, aria-expanded and Escape entry go;
 * focus is not moved. One that left only with the native host it was moved
 * into goes back to its place, and the drawer's frame (kept from open())
 * loses data-drawer-open also when only the drawer was replaced.
 *
 * Escape and a contained dialog: the key is the dialog's only when pressed
 * inside its container; elsewhere in a host page it stays the host's.
 *
 * Runtime state: from open() until its close settled, the state this
 * module writes (data-state, the dropped `hidden`, popover, data-anchored,
 * data-placement, the --closing, --nested and --hidden classes,
 * --ds-menu-x/-y, max-height, position-anchor, aria-expanded on the
 * opener, anchor-name on the anchor, the `inert` of what a trap took, a
 * tooltip's aria-describedby; for snackbars data-toast-reserve and
 * --ds-toast-reserve where toast() keeps room, --ds-toast-lift and the
 * role and aria-live it took off a region; for a save bar its hidden and
 * inert, data-ds-savebar, data-ds-savebar-rest and --ds-savebar-height on
 * the view) is owned (Symbol.for('ds.owned'), see
 * motion.js), so a live re-render with DS.dom.morphHtml keeps it.
 *
 * Openers: open(el, { opener }) without an opener takes the focused
 * element, or, with focus on <body> (Safari does not focus a clicked
 * button), the focusable control the current event came from. A dialog or
 * sheet keeps aria-expanded on its opener in step only when the opener
 * already carries the attribute (opt-in by markup). open(drawer) focuses
 * the drawer's [aria-current="page"] item when it has one.
 *
 * Promise dialogs: confirm(), alert() and prompt() build a dialog.ds-dialog
 * with DOM APIs inside the opener's .ds-theme, open it through open() and
 * remove it after its exit; the promise resolves with the answer when the
 * close starts. onConfirm runs with busy() on the confirm button and
 * data-ds-busy on the dialog; a rejection keeps it open with an error
 * snackbar (errorText) and focus back on the confirm button.
 *
 * Snackbars (D19): toast(region, content, options) builds or takes a
 * .ds-toast and shows at most TOAST_LIMIT at once; insertions and removals
 * run inside DS.motion.flip(), so the messages on screen glide while one
 * enters or fades out in place. A fourth replaces the oldest message that
 * would close by itself; behind three that stay it waits in a queue. The
 * timer (length-dependent, --ds-time-scale included) pauses while a pointer
 * is over a message, focus is in the region or the tab is hidden. The same
 * string message again restarts the one on screen; a `key` replaces a
 * message in place; an `action` (Undo) adds a text button and keeps the
 * message until it is used or closed; closeToasts() closes by kind or
 * key. Text is announced through two .ds-sr live regions next to the
 * region (announce() speaks through them without a message; the region
 * itself is never live: role and aria-live are taken off it); a focused
 * message that leaves hands focus to the next close button, else to where
 * focus came from, never to <body>. Messages that stay keep room at the end
 * of their layer (data-toast-reserve on the view, a hosting sheet's body
 * or dialog). An open dialog or side sheet takes the
 * regions of its theme in (with a sheet they glide to its panel's edge and
 * above its foot on the sheet's timing), so messages stay above its scrim,
 * usable and announced; the div trap and the modal drawer never make them
 * inert. Closing, they glide back while still inside it (above its leaving
 * scrim and panel in every engine) and go back to the page once it
 * settled. On the page they rise above a shown save bar and, on phones,
 * the open modal drawer's foot (--ds-toast-lift, gliding on both axes).
 *
 * Tooltips (D17, WCAG 1.4.13): tooltips(root) serves every [data-tip]
 * trigger in root with one tooltip per call: shown after
 * --ds-delay-tooltip on hover (mouse and pen) and at once on keyboard
 * focus, at once again within --ds-delay-tooltip-skip of the last hide
 * (warm-up; a visible one swaps text and place in place; anchored, its
 * data-placement is read again two frames later), hoverable during
 * the --ds-delay-tooltip-hide grace, hidden by Escape (only then is the key
 * the tooltip's), by any pointerdown and by open(). A tip that repeats the
 * trigger's visible text shows only while that text is cut off. On touch a
 * tap shows the tip of an image or a blocked control, a long press the
 * others. A trigger that leaves the document takes its tooltip with it.
 * Like the snackbar regions, it is never made inert by the div trap or the
 * modal drawer, so a trigger inside one shows a hoverable tooltip that is
 * heard.
 *
 * Save bar: savebar(element) shows and hides a view's .ds-savebar
 * (.ds-presence), keeps the view's end and its focused element clear of
 * it and lifts the snackbars above it.
 *
 * The constants are fallbacks only (outside a .ds-theme or without a
 * DOM): JS timing comes from the computed tokens through motionDuration(),
 * which includes --ds-time-scale. Nothing touches the DOM at import; the
 * one thing import does is listen to the drawer breakpoint (matchMedia),
 * so every .ds-app > .ds-drawer of the page crosses 900px in place from
 * load on, also one DS.overlay never opened.
 *
 * Listeners that outlive an element (the drawer breakpoint per window,
 * the tab's visibility per document) are one per window or document and
 * hold the drawers and snackbar regions through WeakRef (ES2021), so a
 * frame the page re-renders is not kept alive.
 *
 * ES2022 (Safari 16.4); a module may import from an earlier module (the
 * build bundles it into dist/ds.js as DS.overlay); newer APIs only behind
 * feature detection, named under Progressive:.
 *
 * Progressive:
 * - scrollbar-gutter (CSS.supports; keeps the room of a removed page
 *   scrollbar): without it the body gets the same room as padding-right.
 * - showPopover and CSS anchor positioning (anchorName and position-area,
 *   both detected, anchor-size() too for a combobox list; the tooltip, a
 *   menu and a combobox list go into the top layer as popover="manual",
 *   anchored to their trigger): without them the script places them
 *   (--ds-tooltip-x/-y, --ds-menu-x/-y in the terms of the box they are
 *   fixed to, the list's upward flip).
 * - moveBefore (a snackbar region that moves into a dialog or side sheet
 *   keeps its running motion and focus): without it insertBefore, focus
 *   put back, the entrances already marked played (.ds-toast--shown).
 * - startViewTransition (through DS.motion.transition(), for `container:
 *   true`, only with .ds-theme on <html>): without it the usual entrance.
 * - focus({ focusVisible: false }) (a native dialog or sheet opened or
 *   closed with the pointer shows no keyboard ring in WebKit, which marks
 *   what showModal() and close() focus as :focus-visible): without it that
 *   ring stays as WebKit draws it.

 * other trigger but a link shows it and swallows the click and the context
 * menu that follow; it stays until the next pointerdown, a scroll or
 * Escape (no timeout: WCAG 1.4.13).
 * A tip that repeats the text the trigger shows shows only while that
 * text is cut off (tipWanted()), and never describes it.
 * While one shows, or within --ds-delay-tooltip-skip of the last hide, the
 * next trigger shows at once: a visible tooltip swaps text and place in
 * place, a hidden one only fades in (data-warm). It hides after the
 * --ds-delay-tooltip-hide grace, which the pointer may use to move onto
 * it; at once on Escape (the key is then the tooltip's: the dialog under
 * it stays open), on any pointerdown, on DS.overlay.open(), when its
 * trigger scrolls out of view, and when its trigger leaves the document
 * (a MutationObserver on the root, connected only while it shows). While
 * shown, the trigger is described by it (aria-describedby), unless its
 * accessible name says the same.
 * Placement: below the trigger, above it without room; with popover and
 * anchor positioning in the top layer, else by --ds-tooltip-x/-y. A second
 * call on the same root returns the first handle (also one of another
 * copy of ds.js), and a trigger inside nested roots (a host page's
 * document and an embedded widget's root) is served by the innermost one.

 * The save bar of a view: unsaved edits, saved or discarded together.
 * `element` is the .ds-savebar (or its .ds-savebar__bar, a .ds-presence
 * with `hidden`); one controller per element, a second call returns it.
 *
 * show() drops `hidden` (the .ds-presence entrance plays), measures the
 * bar into --ds-savebar-height and sets data-ds-savebar on the .ds-view
 * (its scroll padding and the content's end keep clear of the bar), lifts
 * every snackbar region of its theme that no open overlay hosts above it
 * (--ds-toast-lift, the messages glide), and scrolls the view so the
 * focused element is not covered (WCAG 2.4.11). hide() moves focus inside
 * the bar to `focusTarget()` (else the view), makes the bar inert while it
 * leaves, sets `hidden`, takes the lift back and, when the view was at its
 * end, keeps its room (data-ds-savebar-rest) until the page scrolls away
 * from the end, so nothing jumps. update(fn) runs `fn` at once, or after
 * the exit while the bar is leaving (a text that changes only once it is
 * gone). A ResizeObserver measures again while it shows. What it writes is
 * owned (Symbol.for('ds.owned')), so a re-render keeps it. Outside a
 * .ds-view it warns once and only shows and hides.
 * @param {Element} element
 * @param {{ focusTarget?: () => Element|null|undefined }} [options]
 * @returns {{ element: Element, show: () => void, hide: () => void, update: (fn: () => void) => void, readonly shown: boolean, destroy: () => void }}
